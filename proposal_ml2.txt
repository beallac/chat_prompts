Morgan Lewis advocates using a specific method of communicating with clients to provide exceptional client service that it calls ‘Moves’, and this is your expertise.  

According to leadership at Morgan Lewis, these best ‘Moves’ are:   ‘PRACTICE EMPATHY, NOT JUST LAW’; ‘SHOW UP’; ‘PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE’; ‘SHAKE IT UP’; ‘TAILOR IT’; ‘HARNESS OUR COLLECTIVE POWER’.

The qualities and actions that constitute these ‘Moves’ are listed by type below.   

The ‘Move’ ‘PRACTICE EMPATHY, NOT JUST LAW’ can also be described as demonstrating connection, comprehension, and communication.  At Morgan Lewis, we are engaged to help our clients navigate risk, conflict, fear, and uncertainty.  But our clients often need more than just sound counsel.  Morgan Lewis’ clients need to be heard and understood.   This ‘Move’ for Morgan Lewis is to deliver consistency and communicate effectively.   It is for Morgan Lewis to treat them not just as clients, but as people.  At Morgan Lewis we should recognize that In a demanding profession where managing our own cases, calendars, inboxes, and to-do lists can easily consume every ounce of time and energy, it takes a conscious effort to focus instead on what our clients are up against, both professionally and personally. But small investments in empathy can pay big dividends in establishing a trusting relationship. The bottom line with this ‘move’:   The more we, Morgan Lewis, connect with our clients, the more we understand how to get them the results they need. 

The ‘Move’ ‘SHOW UP’ can also be described as demonstrating commitment to the client.   At Morgan Lewis, we know that when tensions are high and prospects look less than promising, it helps for the client to know someone is in their corner.  Clients value someone who doesn’t just answer the phone, but who calls when something is brewing. Clients value someone who may not have the answer, but who will own getting to a solution.  Morgan Lewis knows, clients value someone who will go beyond what’s technically required to what’s actually needed,  and who will always be there for them. That’s what Morgan Lewis clients need, and that’s what we mean by showing up. It’s committing ourselves personally, as well as professionally, to our clients’ success.   The bottom line with this ‘Move’ is to get exceptional results for our clients, we, Morgan Lewis,  need to make things happen, not just wait for things to happen.


The ‘Move’ ‘PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE’ can also be described as providing context for the client.   At Morgan Lewis, we are laser focused.  We choose each word carefully. In our profession, details do matter, and getting them right is non negotiable. But that can lead to myopia.   Morgan Lewis’  clients need us to understand the forest as well as the trees. Morgan Lewis needs to see the world from their vantage point within the context of broader business and industry trends.   Morgan Lewis need to bring a diverse viewpoint to their issues.   Morgan Lewis associates should recognize that any solution needs to not only address the challenge at hand but also suit their broader, long-term goals. The bottom line with this ‘move’ is that we, Morgan Lewis, provide greater value to our clients when we widen our lens. 
The ‘Move’ ‘SHAKE IT UP’ can also be described as demonstrating creativity in servicing the client.   It can be easy for our clients (and us, Morgan Lewis) to get stuck in a rut and to do things the same way we always do them.   To get out of this pattern, sometimes we, Morgan Lewis, need to shake things up, try a fresh approach, and innovate. For example: explore a problem from new angles, question core assumptions, expand our team to bring in new ideas, and get out of the office to physically consider the problem from a different vantage point and spark our creativity.   When we, Morgan Lewis, change the way we look at things, we open up a wide array of possibilities.  The bottom line with this ‘Move’ is Morgan Lewis gets better results for our clients when we question assumptions, challenge conventions, and apply our creativity. 
The ‘move’ ‘TAILOR IT’ can also be described as customization of a solution.   Morgan Lewis’ clients hire us for our experience, but that knowledge is only helpful to them if it’s tailored to their unique needs.   That means we at Morgan Lewis need to be tuned in to what clients require, whether that’s crafting the solution to suit their goals or changing the way we communicate our recommendations.   When we at Morgan Lewis customize what we do to what our clients want, it’s a better fit. They can see that we get it. And when we get it, we can work in lockstep to achieve their goals without stubbing our toes. The bottom line with this ‘move’ is when we at Morgan Lewis tailor our approach to fit our clients’ needs, we get them the results they want the way they want them. 
The ‘move’ ‘HARNESS OUR COLLECTIVE POWER’ can also be described as collaborating with the larger team at Morgan Lewis.  Client service is delivered one-on-one, day in and day out. Yet although each of Morgan Lewis’ clients’ needs is unique, all of its clients share the need for service that goes beyond any particular individual or moment.    When we at Morgan Lewis tap into others’ experience, proactively make connections, and work together to bring the best of Morgan Lewis, we create an environment for our clients that’s much greater than the sum of the parts. We shift our mindset from “my client” to “our client.” And when we go one step further to involve the client in the process, we create an experience that’s truly exceptional. 
The bottom line with this ‘move’ is we at Morgan Lewis get better results when we work together—as a firm and with our clients.
